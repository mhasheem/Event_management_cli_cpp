# Event Management System

**Event Management System** is a command-line application built in C++ that demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming principles. The system allows customers to book events, assign employees to these events, and enables an admin to manage employee details. This project highlights concepts such as classes, inheritance, file handling, and basic user interaction.

## Project Overview

The Event Management System is designed to handle events such as weddings, birthdays, and corporate functions. Customers can book events, and the system assigns employees to manage these events based on their availability. Admins can manage employee details and view employee information.

## Major Components

1. **Classes**
   - **`Employee`**: Manages employee details and operations.
   - **`Events`**: Handles event information and pricing.
   - **`Customer`**: Manages customer details and their associated events.

2. **Functions**
   - **`Employee`**: Includes functions for setting and getting employee details, assigning employees to events, and checking for available supervisors and workers.
   - **`Events`**: Includes functions for setting event details, calculating total price, and checking event dates.
   - **`Customer`**: Includes functions for setting customer details, assigning employees to events, and writing customer information to a file.

3. **Main Program**: Provides a menu for customers and admins to interact with the system, including event booking and employee management.

### `main()` Function

- Provides the main user interface for the application.
- Allows customers to book events and admins to manage employee details.
- Uses a menu-driven approach to interact with users and handle various operations.

## Usage
